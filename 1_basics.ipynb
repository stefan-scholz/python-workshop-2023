    "\n",
    "Python is a programming language that enjoys great popularity because of various advantages. Some advantages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fast to Learn\n",
    "- Easy to Write\n",
    "- Flexible\n",
    "- Extensive Library Support\n",
    "- Hidden Low-Level Aspects of Computer Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes Python an ideal basis for beginners like us to start programming because of its simplicity. But beyond that it is also used by experts worldwide, e.g. in machine learning and software development, because of its extensive libraries.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Installed from [python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html)\n",
    "- On Linux: already installed or installable as package of the Linux Distribution (Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat, SuSE, etc.)\n",
    "- Otherwise: it's recommended to rely on a distribution which bundles the Python interpreter with common Python modules and tools - esp. [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/), a distribution of Python and R for scientific computing"

    "### Jupyter Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Lab is a very useful interface for Python. Inside Jupyer Lab you can work with Jupyter Notebooks, exactly one like you are looking into right now. These notebooks are one of the possibilities how to write and execute Python code. The major advantage over others is that code can be written very interactively, because the entire code can be divided into smaller snippets, and these snippets are directly next to their output.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook consists of separate text cells and code cells. A cell can be executed either by clicking on the play button in the tool bar on top or by pressing __shift + enter__.\n",

    "If you make a mistake you can always edit the content of a cell and execute it again to update it. You can insert additional cells by clicking on the plus button in the tool bar on top.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Editors\n",
    "\n",
    "A good editor or an [integrated development environment (IDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) will speed up coding by providing autocompletion, syntax highlighting and syntax checking. If your code gets bigger, an IDE supports the development by automated builds and deployments of the code, a runtime for tests and a visual debugger to locate errors (\"bugs\") in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, there are many good IDEs available for Python, to list just a few:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [PyDev](https://www.pydev.org/)\n",

    "Why you need encapsulated environments to run applications or projects? The documentation of the [Python virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) explains...\n",
    "\n",
    "> Python applications will often use packages and modules that don’t come as part of the standard library. Applications will sometimes need a specific version of a library, because the application may require that a particular bug has been fixed or the application may be written using an obsolete version of the library’s interface.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This means it may not be possible for one Python installation to meet the requirements of every application. If application A needs version 1.0 of a particular module but application B needs version 2.0, then the requirements are in conflict and installing either version 1.0 or 2.0 will leave one application unable to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. create a virtual environment in current director in the subfolder `.env/`\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   python3 -m venv .env\n",

    "2. activate the environment\n",

    "   source .env/bin/activate\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. install packages (placed below `./.env/`)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   pip install ...\n",

If the condition is `True`, then the clause is executed, and afterward, the condition is checked again. The first time the condition is found to be `False`, the `while` clause is skipped. If the execution reaches a `break` statement, it immediately exits the `while` loop's clause. When the program execution reaches a `continue` statement, the program execution immediately jumps back to the start of the loop and reevaluates the loop's condition.

    "## 1.10 Classes and Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming, or short OOP, is a programming paradigm which provides a means of structuring programs such that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects. Another common programming paradigm is procedural programming which structures a program like a recipe in that it provides a set of steps, in the form of functions and code blocks, which flow sequentially in order to complete a task. Objects are at the center of the object-oriented programming paradigm, not only representing the data, as in procedural programming, but in the overall structure of the program as well. An object can be anything that has some characteristics and functions. Focusing first on the data, each thing or object is an instance of some class. Also classes are used to create new user-defined data structures that contain arbitrary information about something.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming offers the following advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If code is written in classes, it can be shared by multiple instances and reused multiple times.\n",
    "- The modular structure, in which classes are strictly separated, ensures clear and maintable code.\n",
    "- Through the logical separation of each object, possible errors can be traced back to the actual problem more easily, especially with highly nested code.\n",
    "- When a user writes his code, then it is more clear which object and which data he is working with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these advantages, object-oriented programming also has a few drawbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- With the amount of code and the number of classes, also the overall complexity of the program increases.\n",
    "- If real-world objects and their relations are unclear, then it can be very difficult to find an object-oriented structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a few seconds you will see some examples of how object-oriented programming may look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a blueprint for an object. A class contains all the attributes and methods related to the real-world object. With the keyword `class` you can create such a class, followed by the class name and a colon `:`. You can initialize an object of a class exactly like you use a function. With this object you can work with its attributes and methods over attribute references `object.attribute` as it is common in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see you can initialize an instance like a parameterless function and assign it to a variable. Then you can work with the instance using the corresponding variable. In this first example we will create an empty object, without specialising it further during its initialization. But often we want to pass certain attributes to new objects. To do this, you can write an initialization method `__init__`. When you create your object, you can pass the parameters for that specific object into the class. This syntax is basically the same as with a function again.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the initialization method, `self` refers to the newly created object. In any other method, it refers to the instance whose method was called. However it is nothing more than a convention: the name `self` has absolutely no special meaning to Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us create a class for estimating sentiments with one attribute and four methods."
