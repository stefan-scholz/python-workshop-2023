    "## 3.1 Data Streams\n",
    "\n",
    "In our context, a data stream is a sequence of information. While in a true data stream not all data is available at one point in time, in pseudo data streams the data is completely available but the data is usually so big that the hard drive or memory cannot cope with it. Depending on the type of data stream, it can contain various information, i.e. timestamps, attributes, raw data or processed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These information are streamed in a very broad range of applications. Below are a few examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Application | Description |\n",
    "| -------- | ------- |\n",
    "| Fraud detection | detect patterns and anomalies in banking transactions with time, amount, location |\n",
    "| Click analytics | profile advertisment, social media, websites by user behavior |\n",
    "| News analytics | underpin trading strategy or business decision by automated text analysis on news |\n",
    "| High-frequency trading | make automated trading decision in milliseconds based on live stock prices |\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get a data stream, most of the times either websites are used where the data comes straight from a data provider without being processed, or from APIs where the data is somehow modified, validated or cleaned by some data provider. What this exactly means and how we get access to these data streams, we will learn in today's session.\n"

    "## 3.2 Iterators\n",
    "\n",
    "But before we come to data streams from the internet, we should first learn how data streams are defined in Python. In fact, to work with changing and large data streams, Python offers `Iterator`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our first session, we got to know a similarly named construct called `Iterable`. However, a `Iterable` is a data structure, e.g. list, tuple, dictionary, whereas `Iterator` is more like a pointer which points on certain data. Technically, a `Iterator` is an object that can be iterated upon with the help of the methods `__iter__()` and `__next__()`. Actually most iterables have a build-in iterable to access them. But you can also create your own iterator object which implements the two methods above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The big advantage about iterators is that with large amounts of data not all data need to be stored at once. For example, if we want to access all numbers from $0$ to $10^{50}$, we could try to store all numbers in a list, which will be for sure super large, but will probably not even fit into your memory. Instead we could use an iterator that creates each number after the other, such that only one number has to be stored at a time. This is a typical example where iterators are very helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us create this iterator and return some numbers."

    "## 3.3 Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Until now you have probably strumbled across several error messages when you wrote Python code. In general, these error messages are divided into two categories: First, there are syntax errors, which indicate that at some point in your code you used an invalid command, e.g. you forgot an indent or wrote a colon too much. The interpreter checks for these syntax errors before you code is actually executed. But we do not want to go into detail here. Instead, we want to discuss the second category of error messages. These error messages are problems which the interpreter encounters when it actually executes your code. These errors are also called exceptions. By default, they are fatal and stop your program immediately when the exception occurs.\n",

    "In the following is a list of common exceptions:\n",

    "For the purpose of communication between clients and servers, a wide range of application programming interfaces (APIs) has been developed. An API can appear in different forms, e.g. as web system, operating system or database system. However, in today's session we want to dicuss a specific type called REST APIs. REST is an acronym for REpresentational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. This form of interfaces defines a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations.\n",

But an API is much more generic and abstract and allows for much more requests. The HTTP protocol is used to handle the requests listed below. We will also send requests using the package `requests`. This package is a very powerful package which does a lot of work for us in the background to send such requests. All we have to do is determine our request with a URL, header and parameters."
